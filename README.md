# Traffic Flow Analysis for Local Council

This project, developed as part of our **Software Development 1** coursework, involves analyzing traffic flow data collected by a local council at two road junctions: **Elm Avenue/Rabbit Road** and **Hanley Highway/Westway**. The data, recorded over multiple 24-hour periods, is stored in CSV files and includes details such as vehicle type, travel direction, weather conditions, speed limits, vehicle speed, and more.

## Project Overview:
- **Task A:** Prompt the user for a date to select the corresponding CSV file.
- **Task B:** Analyze the selected dataset and generate key traffic statistics. 
- **Task C:** Save the analysis results in a text file for reporting purposes.
- **Task D:** Visualize the results of the analysis using graphical representations, such as histograms, to showcase trends in traffic flow.

## Features:
- Allows council staff to select CSV datasets by date.
- Processes traffic data to generate summaries and insights.
- Saves analytical results in a text file.
- Displays graphical representations (e.g., histograms) of specific traffic data for easy decision-making using **graphics.py**.
- Uses the **csv** internal module for reading and processing the data from the CSV files.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- **graphics.py** (for GUI and graphical visualization)
- **csv** (for reading and processing the data)

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Sanila-577/traffic-pulze.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program: `python traffic_analysis.py`
4. Choose the CSV dataset file to analyze and view the results.

This project is designed to help local councils make informed decisions regarding traffic management and improve overall traffic flow in the area.
